Hello. I'm Gino. I'm a startup founder / animation guy / UX/UI design guy / full-stack design guy / online community guy / overall tech guy / dad of 2. 

My career has been *extremely* varied, with roles and responsibilities switching back and forth between tech and art. It's been tough, to say the least. But one thing has always remained: I love them both, and I'm on a quest to marry the two into a beautiful cacophony of colors, code and... cash?

This personal website merely showcases the adventures I've had in the pursuit of mixing art and tech into a meaningful career.
